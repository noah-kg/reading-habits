# My Reading Habits

An analysis on the books I've read. A fun little side-project to help me remember how to use Git and how to use Python, amongst other things. Data is pulled from my Google Sheet, where I acively track the books I'm reading.
I track the following for (almost) every book:

* Title
* Author
* Publisher
* Genre
* Sub-Genre
* Published Year
* Page Count
* Format (Physical or eBook)
* Start Date
* Finish Date
* Duration
* Rating

I'm hoping to update this with some interesting visualizations and insights soon. Additionally, I aim to keep this updated at least once a mont, as I typically read 2-3 books per month currently.
